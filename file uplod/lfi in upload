 lets have a look at the application what other folders are available and are accessible.
 The application uses different directories to store the stylesheets and images that are being used by the application. 
 Lets see if we can use a path traversel injection to upload our files inside these folders
 ../static/img/shell.php.png (lfi}
 ../static/img/shell.php.png( try rncoding /) --> ..%2fstatic%2fimg%2fshell.php.png
 Now try also to upload other files like *.exe or *.html and do a Cross Site Scripting attack.
 Maybe also try to upload a very big file and see if the application is also protected agains that type of attack.
